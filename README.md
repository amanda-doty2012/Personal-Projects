<h4>Game Library Project (in progress)</h4>
<p>This is a project designed to catalogue the library of games my partner and I have collected over the years. I will then take that library and create an app that we can use to help us decide what to play based on criteria like play time, rating, number of players, or "fiddly bits."</p>

<p>The second part of this app will allow me to keep track of the games we play, the winner of those games, and our personal rating of the game. This data will display once entered.</p>

<p>Currently, you can see the raw data on the games we have, collected either from the game itself or from Board Game Geek. I am working on transferring the data from a Google Sheet into Java and Python to build the app and data collection methods.</p>



<h4>Health Data (upcoming)</h4>
<p>This project is all about helping me get a handle on my mental and physical health. How does one affect the other? Does going for a stupid daily walk really help my stupid mental health?</p>

<p>I use apps to track my medication intake, I journal, I fill out forms that autopopulate onto spreadsheets.</p>

<p>I will then use SQL and Python to clean and analyze that data, and visualization software to build enticing, easy-to-understand correlations and causations that I can then form into action items.</p>
